# Interns' Daily Learnings Tracker
Welcome to the Daily Learnings Tracker repository for our interns! This repository serves as a centralized hub for tracking the daily learnings and progress of our interns during their training period.

# Purpose:

The purpose of this repository is to provide a structured way for interns to document and reflect on their daily learnings. By maintaining a log of their progress, interns can:

 - Track their learning journey over time.
 - Reflect on what they've learned and reinforce their understanding.
 - Provide visibility to mentors and trainers about their areas of focus and growth.
 - Structure
 - The repository is organized by intern, with each intern having a separate directory. Within each intern's directory, the daily learnings are recorded in individual files or entries. 

## Each entry includes:

- **Date**: The date of the learning.
- **Topic**: The main subject or topic of the learning.
- **Details** : A brief description or summary of what the intern learned.
- **Resources**: Any resources used by the intern, such as articles, tutorials, or books.

- Date: As the file name.
- Topic: The main subject or topic of the learning.
- Details: A brief description or summary of what you learned.
